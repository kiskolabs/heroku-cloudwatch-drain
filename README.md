# heroku-cloudwatch-drain

A Heroku HTTPS log drain that stores logs in CloudWatch Logs.

## Getting started

Build and install:

    $ go install

Run:

    $ heroku-cloudwatch-drain

## Configuration

See all available configuration flags:

    $ heroku-cloudwatch-drain -h

The AWS configuration is picked up from the environment. For a full list of
environment variables and other ways to configure the AWS region, credentials,
etc., see the [SDK
Configuration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html)
page.

## Exception reporting

Set the `HONEYBADGER_API_KEY` environment variable to report panics and errors to Honeybadger.

If you've deployed heroku-cloudwatch-drain to Heroku, see [Honeybadger's Heroku specific instructions](http://docs.honeybadger.io/guides/heroku.html) for more detailed information.

## New Relic Integration

Set the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable to enable the New Relic integration. Optionally, you can set the `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` to customize the app name on New Relic.

## Sending logs

Logs should be sent to this application, with the log group name as the URL
path. For example, if the heroku-cloudwatch-drain is available at
`https://drain.example.com/`, and you wish to collect logs under the log group
name `my-app`, the log drain URL should be `https://drain.example.com/my-app`.

HTTP Basic Auth is supported and can be configured via CLI flags.

Both the CloudWatch Logs log group and log streams are created automatically as
requests come in. A new and unique log stream is created for each process.
